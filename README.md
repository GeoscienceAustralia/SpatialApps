# SpatialApps
SpatialApps
The intention for this repository is for version control of Python scripts written by the members of the Spatial Analysis and Applications
Teams at Geoscience Australia.

Initial thoughts on the structure are that there will be a 'general' folder for general scripts and a 'project' folder for scripts 
specifically developed to support projects.
